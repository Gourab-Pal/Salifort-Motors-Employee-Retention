This project predicts the possibility of an employee to churn or not through machine learning model

Project Description
Overview

Salifort Motors is tackling high employee turnover, which impacts both financial resources and corporate culture. This project aims to predict employee departures and identify key factors driving turnover using statistical and machine learning models.
Objectives

    Analyze Survey Data: Understand reasons behind employee turnover.
    Predictive Modeling: Build models to predict employee turnover using job title, department, projects, and monthly hours.

    Provide Recommendations: Suggest strategies to improve retention and job satisfaction.

Data Sources

    Employee Survey Data: Provided by HR, includes various employee-related features.

Methodology

    Data Preprocessing: Clean, encode, and normalize data.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize data to find patterns.
    Model Building: Develop and compare models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost).
    Model Evaluation: Use cross-validation and metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) to select the best model.
    Feature Importance Analysis: Identify key factors influencing turnover.
    Recommendations: Offer data-driven suggestions to improve retention.
